/**
 Represents exterior and interior values.
 
 - Discussion: In the case there're more condition types and they could change dynamically I would make a dictionary so cases could be loaded from a separate route in form of [index: description]<Int, String>. In case the uppercased values are important I would make another init :) but I'd still use an enum because this way we're not connected to just a string representation and we could for instance use stars instead of labels.
